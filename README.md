- This PCB was designed using Altium CircuitMaker. As such all the documents (including the 3D model) can be viewed here: https://365.altium.com/files/2D9331D2-1D10-43A5-B07C-33C48EE95FB6

- This project is PCB that uses a 555 timer to turn leds on and off in a wave-like pattern. The clock speed can be varied by 2 potentiometers and the output signal is attached to a 4-bit counter. The 4-bit counter connects to a 3:8 decoder, that drives one input high to turn on one LED at a time. The design is further explained in the video below.
